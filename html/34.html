<h4>Chapter 35.5</h4>
<p>
Alex struggled to cut Julia out of their life. Later, Julia told Alex that they never stood up for ((their)) needs, and they journaled about their intent to change.
Some mornings, in those tender moments between sleep and wake, Alex recalled Julia's body silhouetted against the moonlight. Alex wondered, surprised by their own desperation, if anyone other than Julia would do.
</p>
<p>
The days felt shorter without a partner to fill them. Alex took time to watch YouTube videos about cooking.
They considered getting more interested in food.
Alex felt as if they were repellant, and they couldn't deny the lonely ache in their chest.
</p>
<p>December brought drafty evenings and wet socks.</p>
