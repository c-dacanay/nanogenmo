Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Immediately after the break up, Alex realized that they were just neglecting ((their)) mental health, and they journaled about their intent to change.
When Alex was going to bed they remembered David's body silhouetted against the moonlight. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Alex journaled about their fraught familial relationships.
They considered getting more interested in performing arts.
Alex wondered if they were unattractive, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
