<h4>Chapter 41.5</h4>
<p>
Alex couldn't deny the slow monotony of their lifeâ€”in attempt to improve it, Alex went back to a restaurant that just opened often.
They texted Julia once and they got a few messages back, but she were clearly uninterested.
Alex was sure that they were unlovable, and they couldn't deny the lonely ache in their chest.
