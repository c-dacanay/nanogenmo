<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. After the relationship ended, Alex had the dawning realization that they were just naive about relationships, and they journaled about their intent to change.
Every now and then when Alex was going to bed Alex recalled Toni's electric touch against their skin. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Alex couldn't deny the slow monotony of their lifeâ€”in attempt to improve it, Alex spent time at a winery as frequently as they could.

Alex wondered if they were not fun to be around, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
