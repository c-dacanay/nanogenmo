<p>One morning, the dispute they had 1 year, 7 months ago about how Pam was never interested in doing anything social drifted into Alex's head. Alex exhaled slowly. Perhaps it could be resolved with a simple conversation.  Alex resolved to bring it up to Pam next time they saw each other.</p>

They arranged a time to chat. Alex again was angry because they felt that Pam didn't understand that Alex did not enjoy discovering things the way Pam did. There was a chasm in understanding.

<h4>Chapter 57.5</h4>
<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. After the relationship ended, Pam told Alex that they might not be attracting the type of people ((they)) wanted, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was going to bed they couldn't help but think about Pam's electric touch against their skin. Alex sighed and dismissed the thought.
</p>
<p>
Alex journaled about current events.
They texted Pam once, but she didn't respond.
Alex was sure that they were unlovable, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
