<p>One morning, the spat they had 15 days ago about how Gregory put too much emphasis on their sex life floated back into Alex's head. Alex bit their lip.

The couple met up to hash things out. Gregory again told Alex that Alex didn't want to have sex often enough. There was a serious gap. Gregory's voice was harsh. Alex took a deep breath. Alex was furious. The pair fought bitterly.  The fight spelled disaster for their relationship.

The couple later got on the phone to discuss. Alex accused Gregory of not being invested enough in the relationship. They failed to reach a conclusion.  The fight spelled disaster for their relationship.

<h4>Chapter 10.5</h4>
<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. While the relationship fell apart, Alex realized that they had been naive about relationships, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One evening while Alex was making plans for a vacation they thought about Gregory's electric touch against their skin. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Everything felt harder for a while. Alex took time to practice cooking.

</p>
<p>
Alex spent their nights scrolling endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
