 Alex again was upset because they felt that Aubrey didn't understand that Alex just didn't like sex as much as Aubrey. There was some difference in this regard.

Alex felt like a great weight lifted off their shoulders after the relationship ended. Later, Aubrey told Alex that they might be too eccentric, and they journaled about their intent to change.
When Alex was reading about food Alex recalled Aubrey's electric touch against their skin. Alex tried to push Aubrey out of their mind.
</p>
<p>
Alex couldn't deny the slow monotony of their life‚Äîin attempt to improve it, Alex took time to watch YouTube videos about cooking.

Alex was sure that they were unlovable, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

<p>April brought vibrant sunrises and hay fever.</p>
