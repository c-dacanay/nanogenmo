<h4>Chapter 28.5</h4>
<p>
Alex struggled to cut Helen out of their life. Immediately after the break up, Alex realized that they might be overly gregarious, and they journaled about their intent to change.
Every now and then when Alex was making plans for a vacation they thought about the smell of Helen's skin as they held each other. Alex bit their lip and moved on with their day.
</p>
<p>
Time seemed to pass in slow motion. Alex chilled at a winery as frequently as they could.

Alex was sure that they were too desperate, and they couldn't deny the lonely ache in their chest.
</p>
<p>April brought delicate rains and blooming flowers.</p>
