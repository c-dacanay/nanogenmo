  <!-- <p>A.L.E.X. is a computationally-generated relationship simulator, focused on narrating the many romantic exploits of our protagonist Alex. A.L.E.X was originally developed for <a href="https://nanogenmo.github.io/">NaNoGenMo</a> for <a href="http://catn.decontextualize.com/">Computational Approaches to Narrative</a>.</p>
  <p>By approaching people and relationships computationally we were able to encode our own assumptions and ask if they reflected reality. What damages relationships? What factors into initial attraction? What makes a person stay with someone who’s not interested in them?

    <p>Alex is just an average person looking for love. Can a series of computationally simulated relationships help Alex find what they're looking for?</p>
    <p>A.L.E.X 1.0: A Loving EXploration is a generated novel about missed connetions, rules of attraction, and how relationships last and fizzle.</p>
