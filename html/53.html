<h4>Chapter 54.5</h4>
<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Immediately after the break up, Alex had the dawning realization that they were just neglecting ((their)) mental health, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was daydreaming they imagined Richard's body silhouetted against the moonlight. Alex bit their lip and moved on with their day.
</p>
<p>
Alex deleted all the dating apps off their phone (again).
They considered getting more interested in performing arts.
Alex felt certain that they were not fun to be around, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
