<h4>Chapter 51.5</h4>
<p>
Alex struggled to cut Daniel out of their life. After the relationship ended, Alex had the dawning realization that they asked for physical intimacy too much, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was going to bed they remembered Daniel's electric touch against their skin. Alex bit their lip and moved on with their day.
</p>
<p>
Everything felt harder for a while. Alex took time enjoying cooking.
They considered getting more interested in academics.
Alex felt certain that they were repellant, and they couldn't deny the lonely ache in their chest.
</p>
<p>May brought vivid days and hay fever.</p>
