<h4>Chapter 75.5</h4>
<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Later, Alex had the dawning realization that they might be excessively messy, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One evening while Alex was reading about food they thought about Evelyn's electric touch against their skin. Alex wondered, surprised by their own desperation, if anyone other than Evelyn would do.
</p>
<p>
Alex's calendar filled up with ease and Alex took time to practice cooking.

Alex felt as if they were too desperate, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
</p>
<p>June brought golden mornings and hot air.</p>
