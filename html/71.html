They arranged a time to chat. Michael told Alex that Alex didn't want to be intimate often enough. There was a gap in expectations. Michael's voice was gentle, but firm. Alex gasped anxiously.

<h4>Chapter 72.5</h4>
<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Later, Alex realized that they should have put more effort in taking care of ((their)) physical apperance, and they journaled about their intent to change.
Every now and then when Alex was daydreaming they remembered Michael's electric touch against their skin. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Alex couldn't deny the slow monotony of their lifeâ€”in attempt to improve it, Alex started to go to a cheesemaking class as an act of self care.

Alex was sure that they were too desperate, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
