They later met up at Wishbone & Tree to hash things out. Donald again told Alex that Alex was not sexually compatible with Donald. It seemed like there was a gap in expectations. Donald looked at Alex silently, waiting for a response. Alex gasped anxiously. Alex accused Donald of not being invested enough in the relationship. The pair clashed late into the night.  The fight spelled disaster for their relationship.

<h4>Chapter 64.5</h4>
<p>
Alex felt like a great weight lifted off their shoulders after the relationship ended. After the relationship ended, Alex had the dawning realization that they might be lazy and inconsiderate in ((their)) relationships, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One evening while Alex was daydreaming they remembered the curve Donald's neck as he undressed. Alex tried to push Donald out of their mind.
</p>
<p>
Time seemed to pass in slow motion. Alex took time to practice cooking.

Alex felt certain that they were unlovable, and they were overcome with the absence of a best friend and partner.
