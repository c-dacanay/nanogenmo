 Alex again was frustrated because they felt that Lillian never wanted to try new things. Lillian had to admit that she and Alex had  a serious gap.

<h4>Chapter 96.5</h4>
<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Later, Lillian told Alex that they could be too particular about ((their)) partners, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was getting groceries they thought about Lillian's body silhouetted against the moonlight. Alex tried to push Lillian out of their mind.
</p>
<p>
Alex's calendar filled up with ease and Alex took time enjoying cooking.

Alex was sure that they were not fun to be around, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
