<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. While the relationship fell apart, Alex realized that they failed to see the patterns in ((their)) previous relationship experiences, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was daydreaming they couldn't help but think about the curve Nancy's neck as she undressed. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Everything felt harder for a while. Alex took time appreciating cooking.

Alex was sure that they were unattractive, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
