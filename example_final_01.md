valerie_97👀🍑 (2013-03-06): Hey, there's something I want to talk to you about
 Valerie told Alex that Alex needed to take care of themselves better. Valerie was angry.  Valerie's voice was cold. Alex accused Valerie of not being invested enough in the relationship. The couple failed to reach a conclusion.

One day, the argument they had 30 days ago about how Valerie was too immature drifted into Alex's head. Alex pushed the thought the the back of their mind.

Valerie folded their arms, glaring at Alex. Alex gasped anxiously. Alex accused Valerie of not liking them enough. The couple failed to reach a conclusion.

They never saw each other again.
