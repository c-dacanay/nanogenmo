<p>The idea that Alex was never interested in doing what Tracey wanted to do came back to Tracey's mind. Tracey felt themselves shaking with anger.

<h4>Chapter 28.5</h4>
<p>
Alex struggled to cut Helen out of their life. Immediately after the break up, Alex realized that they might be overly gregarious, and they journaled about their intent to change.
Every now and then when Alex was making plans for a vacation they thought about the smell of Helen's skin as they held each other. Alex bit their lip and moved on with their day.
</p>
<p>
Time seemed to pass in slow motion. Alex chilled at a winery as frequently as they could.

Alex was sure that they were too desperate, and they couldn't deny the lonely ache in their chest.
</p>
<p>April brought delicate rains and blooming flowers.</p>

<h4>Chapter 35.5</h4>
<p>
Alex struggled to cut Julia out of their life. Later, Julia told Alex that they never stood up for ((their)) needs, and they journaled about their intent to change.
Some mornings, in those tender moments between sleep and wake, Alex recalled Julia's body silhouetted against the moonlight. Alex wondered, surprised by their own desperation, if anyone other than Julia would do.
</p>
<p>
The days felt shorter without a partner to fill them. Alex took time to watch YouTube videos about cooking.
They considered getting more interested in food.
Alex felt as if they were repellant, and they couldn't deny the lonely ache in their chest.
</p>
<p>December brought drafty evenings and wet socks.</p>

<p>One day, the spat they had a month ago about how Alex only wanted to do activities related to food; only things Alex liked to do floated back into Daniel's head. Daniel exhaled slowly. Perhaps it could be resolved with a simple conversation.  Daniel resolved to bring it up to Alex next time they saw each other.</p> Alex was upset. They fought for hours.

<h4>Chapter 51.5</h4>
<p>
Alex struggled to cut Daniel out of their life. After the relationship ended, Alex had the dawning realization that they asked for physical intimacy too much, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was going to bed they remembered Daniel's electric touch against their skin. Alex bit their lip and moved on with their day.
</p>
<p>
Everything felt harder for a while. Alex took time enjoying cooking.
They considered getting more interested in academics.
Alex felt certain that they were repellant, and they couldn't deny the lonely ache in their chest.
</p>
<p>May brought vivid days and hay fever.</p>

The couple arranged a time to hash things out. Richard again was upset because he felt that Alex didn't want to be intimate often enough. It seemed like a serious gap. Richard's voice was soft, but firm. Alex took a deep breath. Alex accused Richard of not being invested enough in the relationship. The couple argued bitterly.

<h4>Chapter 54.5</h4>
<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Immediately after the break up, Alex had the dawning realization that they were just neglecting ((their)) mental health, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was daydreaming they imagined Richard's body silhouetted against the moonlight. Alex bit their lip and moved on with their day.
</p>
<p>
Alex deleted all the dating apps off their phone (again).
They considered getting more interested in performing arts.
Alex felt certain that they were not fun to be around, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

The couple later met up at Potter & Cream to continue the conversation. Latoria again was frustrated because she felt that Alex didn't want to be intimate often enough. It seemed like there was a serious gap. Latoria asked Alex if there was anything they could do to help.. Alex blinked slowly. Alex accused Latoria of not liking them enough. They failed to reach a conclusion.  The fight spelled disaster for their relationship.

<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. After the relationship ended, Pam told Alex that they might not be attracting the type of people ((they)) wanted, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was going to bed they couldn't help but think about Pam's electric touch against their skin. Alex sighed and dismissed the thought.
</p>
<p>
Alex journaled about current events.
They texted Pam once, but she didn't respond.
Alex was sure that they were unlovable, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

<p>
Alex felt like a great weight lifted off their shoulders after the relationship ended. After the relationship ended, Alex had the dawning realization that they might be lazy and inconsiderate in ((their)) relationships, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One evening while Alex was daydreaming they remembered the curve Donald's neck as he undressed. Alex tried to push Donald out of their mind.
</p>
<p>
Time seemed to pass in slow motion. Alex took time to practice cooking.

Alex felt certain that they were unlovable, and they were overcome with the absence of a best friend and partner.

 Alex again was mad because they felt that Bruno only wanted to do activities related to politics, sports, or academics; only things Bruno liked to do. There was a gap in expectations.

<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. After the relationship ended, Alex had the dawning realization that they could be too particular about ((their)) partners, and they journaled about their intent to change.
Every now and then when Alex was getting groceries they couldn't help but think about the smell of Bruno's skin as they held each other. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Alex journaled about achieving their goals.

Alex wondered if they were not fun to be around, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.
</p>
<p>October brought beautiful mornings and colorful leaves.</p>

Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Later, Alex realized that they should have put more effort in taking care of ((their)) physical apperance, and they journaled about their intent to change.
Every now and then when Alex was daydreaming they remembered Michael's electric touch against their skin. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Alex couldn't deny the slow monotony of their life‚Äîin attempt to improve it, Alex started to go to a cheesemaking class as an act of self care.

Alex was sure that they were too desperate, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Later, Alex had the dawning realization that they might be excessively messy, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One evening while Alex was reading about food they thought about Evelyn's electric touch against their skin. Alex wondered, surprised by their own desperation, if anyone other than Evelyn would do.
</p>
<p>
Alex's calendar filled up with ease and Alex took time to practice cooking.

Alex felt as if they were too desperate, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

They considered getting more interested in literature.

 Alex again told Toni that Toni never wanted to go out. Toni had to admit that she and Alex had  some difference in this regard. Alex folded their arms, glaring at Toni. Toni gasped anxiously.

<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. After the relationship ended, Alex had the dawning realization that they were just naive about relationships, and they journaled about their intent to change.
Every now and then when Alex was going to bed Alex recalled Toni's electric touch against their skin. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Alex couldn't deny the slow monotony of their life‚Äîin attempt to improve it, Alex spent time at a winery as frequently as they could.

Alex wondered if they were not fun to be around, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

<p>September brought frosty leaves and colorful leaves.</p>

<h4>Chapter 88.5</h4>
<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Immediately after the break up, Alex realized that they were just neglecting ((their)) mental health, and they journaled about their intent to change.
When Alex was going to bed they remembered David's body silhouetted against the moonlight. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Alex journaled about their fraught familial relationships.
They considered getting more interested in performing arts.
Alex wondered if they were unattractive, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. While the relationship fell apart, Alex realized that they had been naive about relationships, and they journaled about their intent to change.

<p>
Everything felt harder for a while. Alex took time to practice cooking.

Alex felt as if they were repellant, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

<p>
Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. While the relationship fell apart, Alex realized that they failed to see the patterns in ((their)) previous relationship experiences, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was daydreaming they couldn't help but think about the curve Nancy's neck as she undressed. In that moment Alex felt overcome with affection, and loss.
</p>
<p>
Everything felt harder for a while. Alex took time appreciating cooking.

Alex was sure that they were unattractive, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

Alex knew the break up was for the best, but it didn't feel that way. Later, Lillian told Alex that they could be too particular about ((their)) partners, and they journaled about their intent to change.
One night, while Alex was getting groceries they thought about Lillian's body silhouetted against the moonlight. Alex tried to push Lillian out of their mind.
</p>
<p>
Alex's calendar filled up with ease and Alex took time enjoying cooking.

Alex was sure that they were not fun to be around, and they scrolled endlessly on their phone, searching for someone.

Sunday arrived. The two of them made out vigorously on the street upon seeing each other. Alex was enraptured.

<p>One morning, the argument they had 2 months ago about how Gertrude didn't understand that Alex did not enjoy discovering things the way Gertrude did floated back into Alex's head.
